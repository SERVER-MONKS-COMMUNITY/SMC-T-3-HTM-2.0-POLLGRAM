# _SMC-T3-HTM-2.0_
## Project Name: - POLLGRAM 
**Tagline** - We have created a website accessible by anyone and anywhere; where they can create polls for their own purposes such as surveys, fun, opinion, governmental schemes, etc. Through this 'Creators' will get to know their audience well, also 'Goverment' will get to know the demands of public. This platform is secured and authentic because we have used secured backend platform for it and also we have linked it with Aadhar system so problems like duplication, fake Id's and any unwated nuisance will not be created. Also we have suggestion section if people are  not satisfied with the options in the poll they can suggest another options.

**The problem it solves** - POllGRAM is such a place where you can get systematically arranged statistics for the poll you have created and to increase its genuiness people are needed to link their Aadhar card also called as KYC to cast their vote. It solves many bigger problems such as it amplifies the interaction between government and people, as government can now take opinions from people on their projects and schemes, also by using it we can get a look around conditions during elections. Content creators no matter from which field they are if they run out of ideas they can cast their poll here to know their audiences mind and what they are willing to watch. Also you an gather your friends family and can create enjoyable polls as we have different varieties of polls which are easy to understand.

**Challenges we ran into** - Our primary problem was security of this website which we have solved using safest backend frameworks, another one was how we can take care of casting of duplicate votes or fake votes so we introduced Aadhar system so no one can misuse the platform. Last problem was arranging interesting and creative polls, also to arrange their data in a simple way so that users will understan it with ease.  

**Technology we used** - Django framework platform, HTML and CSS

Our Motto
