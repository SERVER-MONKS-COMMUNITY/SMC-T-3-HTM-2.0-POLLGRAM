# _SMC-T3-HTM-2.0_
## Project Name: - POLLGRAM 
**Description** - We have created a website accessible by anyone and anywhere; where they can create polls for their own purposes such as surveys, fun, opinion, governmental schemes, etc. Through this 'Creators' will get to know their audience well, also 'Goverment' will get to know the demands of public. This platform is secured and authentic because we have used secured backend platform for it and also we have linked it with Aadhar system so problems like duplication, fake Id's and any unwated nuisance will not be created. Also we have suggestion section if people are  not satisfied with the options in the poll they can suggest another options.

**Technology we used** - Django framework platform, HTML and CSS

Our Motto
> To provide simple and better platform for people with goals.
